## Introduction
The first certification offered by FreeCodeCamp (FCC) relates to the fundamentals of front-end design with a focus on the basic aspects of a web UI and how the User may interact with a website. The lessons provided a foundation of using basic HTML and CSS, and gave insights to more advanced development concepts like Visual Design and Accessibility.

Each of the five projects required for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification will be housed in this folder throughout their development, and documentation in each project's direct folder will provide greater background information specific to the project.
