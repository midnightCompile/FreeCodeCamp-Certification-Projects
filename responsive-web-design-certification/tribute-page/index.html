                <h2>About Leonardo da Vinci:</h2>
                <p>Few historical figures have lived to reach the notoriety of Leonardo da Vinci, who is broadly considered to be one of the greatest polymaths of all time. His talents were many and widley varied, and included skills such as chemistry, metallurgy, painting, philosophy, architecture, and engineering. Although he underwent a brief period of tutelage, much of his knowledge was gained through self-education. 
                <br><br>
                Throughout his life, Leonardo embraced experiential learning. Although many details in his life remain enigmatic, his insatiable quest for knowledge led to him keeping detailed notes through the numeros years and has helped to shed light on a number of his personal interests and experiences. There are an estimated 13,000 pages of notes and drawings that were created by Leonardo during his life as he made continual observations of the world around him. The notes fuse artwork with his observations and philosophy, and are considered to be a forerunner of modern science.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of Leonardo's work is the ongoing impact that it has had throughout history. During his lifetime, some of his artwork was considered masterful by top Renaissance Artists, and a number of those pieces are still displayed today, including The Mona Lisa, which is draws worldwide attention in the Louvre. Additionally, he designed a number of structures for various municipalities, which varied from bridges, to bulidings, and even defense structures to prevent invasion. While a number of the works contained in his notes did get shared during his time, a great many observations and proposed inventions were never publicized. Today, these items stll provide intrigue to individuals studing da Vinci's work, and in recent years some of his creations have even been tested by modern engineers.
